# Binary-number-sequential-using-Python


This code is in Python and performs the following tasks:
Part 1: Doc string description

Part 2: Converting n to binary and splitting it into F and S

Part 3: Splitting the binary number into F and S

Part 4: Converting F and S to decimal

Part 5: Adding one to F and S and multiplying

Part 5: Returning the value of the SplitBinary function

Part 6: Writing the SplitBinary function

Part 7: Sequence starting from the input 

Part 8: Writing the for loop to generate the sequence. 

Part 9: Printing of sequence elements or messages

Part 10: Exit the loop properly after 20 duplicates

Part 11: Exit the loop properly when a duplicate was found. 

Part 12: Attempts in giving the SplitBinary sequence

Part 13: Give the SplitBinary sequence

Part 14: SplitBinary function is only for Step 1 and you get the sequence in later steps by calling SplitBinary repeatedly.
